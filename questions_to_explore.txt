Do age ratings have an effect on the ratings of a game? do games that everyone (from kids to adults) can play have more success? mature games have more chance to be rated highly.

which category/genres/themes of games have high ratings? done

do follows/forks/hypes have an effect on ratings of a game? no correlation with ratings but had correlation with rating count

do games with more no of videos/websites get more hype/more rating? can't be answered with the data at hand.

which platforms have high avg rating? averages are skewed because of the rating distribution. So median rating was considered. iOS.

which player_perspectives have high avg rating? Most popular views have good ratings.

based on release_date, what's the trend over time? 
Over the time, are the games getting higher rating? Not insightful. But in the last 5 years, we see an increasing trend in the median rating.

are unique games (games that don't have 0 similar games vs games that have many similar games) more successful?

how successful are remakes?

if more companies are involved in developing or publishing the game (involved_companies), does it make it get more rating?

are multi player games more successful than single player? Can clearly see that multi player games are more successful.

Would be interesting to see if higher rating means more sales. In most of the cases, we can expect this to be true but in some cases it is not.
Some games are exceptionally reviewed and rated higher but the sales are low for many reasons (game difficulty, price, appeal)

Insight: People love some genres or themes but very few games came out so far. There might be untapped areas to develop more in these genres and create a win-win situation for both game developing studios and gamers.

follows and hypes look interesting

If there are separate ratings for gameplay, controls, level design, challenge, characters, etc. it would give more insight into what actually makes a game great.
